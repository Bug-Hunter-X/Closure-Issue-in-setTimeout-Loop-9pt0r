This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript closure issue within a `setTimeout` loop. The initial code exhibits unexpected behavior where the variable `i` always outputs its final value (10) instead of the expected sequential values (0-9). The solution showcases how to properly capture the variable's value using an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to maintain the correct context for each iteration.
